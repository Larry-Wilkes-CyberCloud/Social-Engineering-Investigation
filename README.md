If you identify malicious content within the emails, you will need to write a brief report detailing why it is malicious.

Phishing is when someone attempts to fraudulently obtain your personal information and security credentials via an electronic message that impersonates a trustworthy entity. The message will often instruct you to follow a link and then enter your personal information.

To ensure that a website is a safe and genuine ANZ page, please make sure that you are on a secure website by checking if there is a Socket Layer (SSL) Certificate. To check that you are on a site with a SSL Certificate:

→ Check the address bar of your browser to see if ANZs website address has changed from http:// to https://

→ Check to see if a security icon that looks like a lock or a key is visible near the address bar on any page that you need to enter your security credentials. Clicking on the icon will provide you with more information about ANZ's SSL Certificate.

To minimise your chances of becoming a victim of a Phishing scam:

→ Treat all emails that request your personal information or security credentials with caution. ANZ will not send you an email asking for your personal information or your security credentials.

→ If you use a password to access your online accounts, change it on a regular basis.

→Keep your anti-virus and firewalls up-to-date and perform regular scans of your computer.

If you are unsure if the email is really from ANZ contact the Customer Service Centre before following any instructions or clicking on any links contained in the email.

I have been assigned 7 emails to investigate. Some of these emails may contain content which can be classed as malicious, due to a number of reasons. They may contain malicious attachments, suspicious links, or Phishing attempts to gather private account information from the user.

You are expected to report your findings on each email, so that we can either block or release these emails to the users.
